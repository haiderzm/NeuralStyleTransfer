### What is Neural Style Transfer

##### Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images—a content image and a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter)—and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image.

### Model Used
##### Pre-trained VGG-19
